# MMRI-SE-ResNet
The MMRI-SE-ResNet thesis investigates the application of deep learning techniques, particularly leveraging a residual neural network, to predict the Kellgren-Lawrence grade (KLG) in osteoarthritis patients utilizing magnetic resonance images (MRI). The proposed model integrates MRI slice numbers and segmented images, offering a unique approach by processing each image slice individually to enhance focus and interpretability. Empirical findings demonstrate promising performance in KLG prediction, highlighting the model's potential for accurate osteoarthritis diagnosis. Additionally, the thesis incorporates residual blocks and the Squeeze and Excitation network to further enhance its effectiveness.
